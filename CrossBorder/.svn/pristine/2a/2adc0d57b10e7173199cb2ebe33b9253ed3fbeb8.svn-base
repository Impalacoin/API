Arbitration replaces the right to go to court, including the right to a jury and the right to participate in a class action or similar proceeding. In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding.<br />
                          <br />
                          The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award if so requested by You or Cashswift Money Transfer , and may not modify, rewrite, or otherwise reform these Terms, including but not limited to interpreting the Terms beyond the range of semantic permissibility. The arbitrator, in his or her discretion, shall have the right to award reasonable costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. These Terms shall be governed according to the laws of the State of Washington and all activities performed in connection with the Service shall be deemed to have been performed in Washington. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to Use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br />

Disputes include not only claims that relate directly to Cashswift Money Transfer , but also its successors, assignees, employees, and agents, and claims for which Cashswift Money Transfer may be directly or indirectly liable, even if it is not properly named at the time the claim is made. Disputes include claims based on any theory of law, contract, statute, regulation, tort (including fraud or any intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable ground, and include claims asserted as counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, interpleaders or otherwise. Disputes include claims made as part of a class action or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Disputes also include claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions.<br />
                          <br />
                          If we initiate the arbitration, we may serve You at the last known physical or email address on file with Us.

However, You and Cashswift Money Transfer agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the city and county of Lynnwood, Washington.
