# HOWTO use this script:
# * Be sure to back up the databases that are to be initialized if you wish to
#   preserve the data in them.
# * Ensure that the databases to be initialized are not open as the script 
#   runs.
# * Set the appropriate variables at the beginning of the script according to
#   your environment.
# * The unzip program should be available in your environment.

# Some notes on PostgreSQL:
# By default, PostgreSQL has a database called template1 containing privileges 
# and other housekeeping data and an adminstrative user named postgres. Unless 
# your system uses socket credentials, the postgres database user initially has 
# no password. To assign it a password (or to override the password assigned by 
# socket credentials), do as follows:
#
# * Become the user "postgres" by becoming superuser then "su - postgres"
# * Execute the following command:
# $> psql -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword'" -d template1
# The command above assigns the postgres user the password 'newpassword'.



# Initialize the following variables as appropriate:
DB_USERNAME="airtel"
DB_PASSWORD="LignuAv7"
DB_HOST="localhost"


# There should be no need to change anything below this line.
echo "Starting database initialization script..."

export PGUSER=$DB_USERNAME
export PGHOST=$DB_HOST
export PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD

# Copy data to be imported into the Linux temporary folder
cp -fr ../etc/sql/data/* /tmp



psql -f ../etc/sql/tables.postgres.sql -d postgres

psql -f ../etc/sql/tables.quartz.sql -d postgres


echo "Have finished initializing database."
