Client Interface for external integrators

Production Application: http://airtime.impalapay.com


======
Design
======

- Client able to: query balance, query transaction Id status, query forex rates,
  send money
  
- Upper limit to be set for daily amount sent to recipient and number of daily
  transactions to recipient. No other limit imposed except for balance of client
  account
  



Security Considerations:
* Authorization - procedures must be provided to verify that the user can make 
  the requested transactions.
* Confidentiality assures you that data is not disclosed to unauthorized 
  persons, processes, or devices.
* Integrity assures you that any data sent between users is guaranteed not to 
  have been tampered with in transit.
* Authentication assures you that people you deal with are not imposters and are
  trusted.
* Non-Repudiation confirms that once the data has been sent, the sender cannot 
  be able to deny that he/she sent the data. The user is provided with proof of
  the transaction and the recipient is assured of the userâ€™s identity.
* Anti-replay - this stops users from resending data in an effort to pretend 
  they are someone else. For example, if 2 users communicate and complete their
  conversation, a malevolent third user may try communicating to one of the 
  parties pretending to be the other valid party.
* Eliminate internal fraud
* Ease of technical implementation

The following are some of the problems that cryptography helps to alleviate:
* Lack of Privacy: people catching information in transit and reading it.
* Identity Spoofing: this is where a malevolent user disguises his / her 
 identity in order to gain access.
* Data Modification: this is the changing of data in transit.
* Replay Attacks: this is when a host captures another host's response to a 
  system and uses this information to attempt to gain access to the system at a 
  later stage.
* Middleman Attacks: this is when a host sits between 2 communicating hosts, and
  transparently monitors, captures and relays all communication between the 
  hosts. Sometimes also referred to as Man-In-The-Middle attacks.
* Password Attacks: attempting to figure out a username / password combo to gain
  access to a system.
  
  
============
To Do
============
* Create Apache HttpComponents for sample HTTP and HTTPS calls
* No fetching of items from the RDBMS using Id
* Rename package com.impalapay.airtel.persistence.geolocaion to 
  com.impalapay.airtel.persistence.geolocation
* BeanProcessor in DAOs to be global
* SessionLog does not need to extend StorableBean
=============
Connect to Airtel
=============
*Airtel webservice Endpoint url:http://196.216.73.150:9990/switch-rest/request/methodname

============
Highlight
============
if an account is made inactive make a new build of the project.
